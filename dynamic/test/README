o To run the regression test you need to run it under tcl/tk: 

    tclsh interp-regression.tcl <source>  
          where <source> is one of 'sparc' or 'pentium'


o To run benchmark collection results, select the benchmark (099.go in 
  this example) and use the configure file at the top directory: 

    runspec -c sun-emu.cfg -T base -i ref 099.go


o To collect timing information, you can use the time or timex commands 
  in the *.cfg file, e.g.: 

	monitor_wrapper=timex sh -c '%command%'

  you then need to be in a csh to run the following command: 

    echo go `runspec -c sun.cfg -T base -i ref 099.go |& egrep "real|user|sys"` >! result/go.results.txt

  which will produce a file called go.results.txt in this case with the 
  timing information: 

    cat result/go.results.txt
    go real 5:02.45 user 5:00.94 sys 0.03 real 4:10.12 user 4:08.78 sys 0.03 real 4:15.53 user 4:14.16 sys 0.04


o To collect timing information for the pathfinder, use the sun-pathfinder.cfg 
  file for the SPEC INT95 benchmarks: 

    runspec -c sun-pathfinder.cfg -T base -i ref <benchmark-name>
