\chapter*{Preface}

The \walk\ project was an initial investigation conducted
in 2001 at Sun Labs in relation to dynamic binary translation. 
The project ran for 9 months and was led by Cristina Cifuentes, 
with input from 3 different interns; Nathan Keynes, David Ung
and Bernard Wong, and one other researcher, Brian Lewis. 

\walk\ was built based on ideas from the UQBT project (see 
\url{http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/csm/uqbt.html}, and as such 
aimed at retargetable experimentation through specification of 
features of machines.  In fact, the New Jersey Machine Code 
SLED specifications and the UQBT SSL specifications were reused
to automatically generate disassemblers and interpreters for the 
SPARC and x86 architectures.   

We hope that others will make use of the framework; many types
of experimentation can be done with the current design and 
its partial implementation.
