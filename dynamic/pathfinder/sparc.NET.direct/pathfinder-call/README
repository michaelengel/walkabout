Note, this profile is not complete.
Next executing tail that will instrument calls aswell,
end of trace condition is still back branch.
Fibonacci still fails under this scheme.

Solution:
should have a different scheme if start of trace is 
a call.  ie, different end of trace cond for different
start of traces.
